- heading: Adding a new section
  headingSize: 2
  contentBlocks:
  - raw: To add an additional section, simply add a new section node with a heading, (optional) heading size and as many `contentBlocks` as required. In the example below we've added a new 'Acknowledgements' section and converted the `text` type to a `raw` type to inject raw markdown which ensures the links are displayed correctly.
