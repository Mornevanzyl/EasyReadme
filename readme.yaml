- heading: Adding a new section
  headingSize: 2
  contentBlocks:
  - raw: To add an additional section, simply add a new section node with a heading, (optional) heading size and as many `contentBlocks` as required. In the example below we've added a new 'Acknowledgements' section and converted the `text` type to a `raw` type to inject raw markdown which ensures the links are displayed correctly.

  contentBlocks:
  - raw: You can easily add a list by using a `contentBlocks` type `bulletList` or `orderedList` as required. The latter will generate a numbered list.

- heading: Adding a codeblock
  headingSize: 2
  contentBlocks:
  - raw: Codeblocks may be added to your README by using a `contentBlocks` type `codeBlock`. The content is added using the `content` property and optional syntax support is specified using the `type` property. The demo below shows how to add a [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) codeblock and then a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) codeblock.
  - blockQuote: ðŸ’¡ Remember to add a `|` or `>` after `content` property to ensure multi-line support for strings. Correct indentation is also crucial.
